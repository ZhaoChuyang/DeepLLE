    A global dictionary that stores information about the datasets and how to obtain them.
    It contains a mapping from strings
    (which are names that identify a dataset, e.g. "coco_2014_train")
    to a function which parses the dataset and returns the samples in the
    format of `list[dict]`.
    The returned dicts should be in DeepISP Dataset format (See README.md for details)
    if used with the data loader functionalities such as dataset loader and transforms.
    The purpose of having this catalog is to make it easy to choose
    different datasets, by just using the strings in the config.
