# Prepare Datasets


# Test Datasets
DICM, LIME, MEF have no ground truth images, so we can only do inference on these datasets and assess the performance perceptually.

For LOL, VE-LOL, SICE and Mit-Adobe FiveK datasets, we can take the full-reference assessment metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, MAE and MSE to evaluate the performance.
